Fairness in Time series Anomaly Detection and Prediction

<strong> Doctoral Researcher, IIT Palakkad (July, 2018 - Aug 2023) </strong>
Robust Method for Anomaly Detection and Extreme Event Prediction in Time Series

Projects

- WaRTEm-AD: Developed a warping resilient model for anomaly detection in univariate time series data with help of novel warp operators, data augmentation and Twin Autoencoder model [[Code]](https://github.com/WaRTEm-AD/UnivariateAnomalydetection)
- DXtreMM: Developed a deep model for extreme event prediction in time series combined with a mixture of probability distributions [[Code]](https://github.com/DXtreMM/DXtreMM_TSF)
- WRADMts: Developed a similarity based alignment technique for multivariate time series data for anomaly detection considering temporal and intervariable dependencies
